# Project Outline:
Development of production ready Machine Learning  Models for Binary Classification. The project aims to create and compare optimized ML models on data sources for binary classification problem. This project is done in a team of 6 team members. Testing different algorithms classification with Imbalance class data

## Project Outline:
In this project, Imbalance dataset is analyzed in several steps:

* Data cleaning and preprocessing using Preprocess module.
* Fitting XGBoost, SVM, randomforest and LightGBM models, and using Hyperopt and Optuna.
* Unit testing and integration testing of all the developed libraries using pytest.
* Comparing of different fitted models and optimization methods against each other and AutoML of GCP.
* Comparing the results with previous papers.
